Implementation of Soft Actor Critic in OpenAI-Gym BipedalWalker-v0 environment

First experience with Neural Networks & Reinforcement Learning, the code is taken from https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/ and rivisited.

--> apply soft actor critic to Bipedal Walker to learn it to walk without falling anymore



# Approach and documentation

See the [report](reportAI2B.pdf) where also results are showed: with this type of system I cannot achieve very good results in terms of final score, but only a week learning; with more time available it was certainly possible to achieve a good performance for the agent.


NB: this was my first approach with RL techniques, so obviously it's not a perfect job, but it's still valid.
